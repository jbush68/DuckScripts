# Howdy!

This repository is just a collection of my one-off python scripts used to either solve a quick problem through python or just scripts used to practice and demonstrate my python abilities.
As I add scripts to this repository, I will also add a brief description of what the script does and why it was created.

Note: This repository was created on 2/27/24 and has scripts that were created prior to this date however they will not be dated as such.

# Script Descriptions

### Kronecker Matrix
This is a short python script that creates a randomized matrix based on dimensions of a user input. Following that it creates a Kronecker matrix based on the randomized matrix. The Kronecker matrix is then printed to the console.
In addition to printing a Kronecker matrix, the script also generates a barcode based on the transposition of the Kronecker matrix. The barcode is then printed to the console.

This script was created as part of an assignment for an Introductory Python class, however, was modified to abuse different python tricks such as list comprehensions to make the code as unreadable as possible. The motivations for this are unknown as the original was created 2 years ago.

Both the original and modified versions of the script are included in the python file.
